## Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. Here are the key components and concepts:

### Neural Network Architecture
* Input Layer: Receives raw data and normalizes it for processing
* Hidden Layers: Multiple layers that transform data through weighted connections
* Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or output
* Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) that help networks learn complex patterns

### Key Deep Learning Concepts
1. Backpropagation
   * Algorithm for calculating gradients in neural networks
   * Efficiently updates weights by propagating error backwards through the network
   * Uses chain rule to compute partial derivatives

2. Gradient Descent Optimization
   * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
   * Mini-batch Gradient Descent
   * Adaptive optimizers (Adam, RMSprop)

3. Loss Functions
   * Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
   * Cross-Entropy Loss for classification
   * Custom loss functions for specific tasks

4. Regularization Techniques
   * Dropout: Randomly deactivates neurons during training
   * L1/L2 Regularization: Adds penalty terms to prevent overfitting
   * Batch Normalization: Normalizes layer inputs for stable training

### Deep Learning Architectures

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   * Specialized for processing grid-like data (images)
   * Key components: Convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers
   * Applications: Image classification, object detection, segmentation

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   * Process sequential data with memory of previous inputs
   * Variants: LSTM, GRU for handling long-term dependencies
   * Applications: Time series prediction, natural language processing

3. Transformers
   * State-of-the-art architecture for sequence processing
   * Self-attention mechanism for capturing relationships
   * Applications: Language models, machine translation, text generation

4. Autoencoders
   * Unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction
   * Encoder-decoder architecture
   * Applications: Feature learning, denoising, anomaly detection
